currently inactive [Toribash](https://www.toribash.com/about.html) clone project.
# Depends on
* Raylib 5.0 ([raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib))
* Open Dynamics Engine 0.16.4 ([odedevs/ode](https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode/)) 
* LuaJIT >=2.1 ([LuaJIT/LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT))
* (Any Lua >=5.1 should work fine technically)
# Building
basically you need to compile each library by following their instructions, i will add a better way to build one day in the future hopefully, probably using CMake.
